                Adding to 10 is foundation for more complex math.  This game is designed for children to have fun while practicing mental math skills.  For younger kids, they can use dots to count up the values and also adjust the sum to a number as small as 5.  For more of a challenge choose a sum of 60 to practice minutes to an hour or 100 to make change for a dollar.
