                Every time you clear a level, the wall speed will increase or the total will change (or both) depending on your setting and level. Sums 5-10 will randomly choose a between among 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.  Sums 5-20 will randomly choose up to 20 and Sums 5-100 will include 5-20, 60 and 100.  If you can't find the missing addend, drop the current tile into an empty space.
