            <p>
                <strong>Make 10</strong> as many times as you can before the wall reaches the top!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break the wall by tapping the tile that will add to 10 with your current tile.</li>
                        <img src="HowTo.png">
                        <li>Every time you clear a level, the wall speed will increase or the total will change (or both) depending on your setting and level.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Adding to 10</strong> is a fundamental skill necessary for more complex math.
                <ul>
                    <li>This game is designed for children to have fun while practicing mental math.</li>
                    <li>Younger kids can use Mahjong style dots to count up the values and also adjust the total to a number as small as 5.</li>
                    <img src="Mahjong.png">
                    <li>For more of a challenge choose a sum of <strong>60 to practice minutes to the hour</strong> or <strong>100 to make change for a dollar</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Not just for kids!</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone can test their mental math abilities.</li>
                    <li>Who will set the high score on your device?</li>
